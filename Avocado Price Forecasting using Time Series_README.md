🥑 Avocado Price Forecasting using Time Series
This project applies Time Series Forecasting (TSF) techniques to analyze and predict avocado prices over time. The dataset includes average avocado prices across different regions and types in the US.

📊 Project Overview
The goal is to:

Explore avocado price trends

Preprocess and visualize time series data

Apply forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, or other ML models)

Evaluate prediction performance

Provide insights into future pricing trends

🧠 Methods & Tools Used
Python

Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Statsmodels / ARIMA (or your applied TSF model)

Jupyter Notebook

Time Series Analysis concepts

📁 Files
Avocado_TSF.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing code, visualizations, and analysis steps.

🗂️ Dataset
The dataset used is a cleaned avocado pricing dataset (assumed to be preloaded or downloaded from Kaggle or a public source). It contains:

Date of price

Average Price

Type (conventional/organic)

Region

You may need to download the dataset or place it in the same directory as the notebook before running it.

🔍 Key Features
Time Series Decomposition

Trend & Seasonality Analysis

Train/Test Split for Time Series

Forecasting using statistical models

Performance metrics (e.g., MAPE, RMSE)

🏁 Getting Started
Requirements
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels jupyter

📌 Example Output
Sample forecast plot and metrics are included in the notebook, such as:

📈 Time series plots of avocado price trends

🔮 Forecast graphs with future projections

📉 Residual plots and error analysis
